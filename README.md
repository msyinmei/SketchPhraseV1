SketchPhrase!

A collaborative party game that mixes elements of telephone and pictionary.

The game starts with Player 1 writing down a well-known phrase or person and passing it on. Player 2 sees Player 1's phrase, and must translate it into a drawing. From there, each additional player must translate the preceding phrase/drawing back into a drawing/phrase â€“ all while only seeing the last drawing/phrase. The game ends when each player has gone once, at which time all players see the entire phrase/drawing chain.
